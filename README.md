# TermiList
TermiList is a to-do list cli application created using a Bash Script that lets you create to do list items directly in the terminal. You can run this script everytime you need to update the to do list since this script will append onto the txt file that was generated during your first run. It will also let you create a directory to store the txt file and check if you already have a directory by the same name, so you won't have to worry about created a duplicate directory. This way you can store mulitple lists in mulitple directories.

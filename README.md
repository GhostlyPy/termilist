# TermiList
TermiList is a to-do list cli program created using a Bash Script that lets you create to do list items directly through the terminal.

```bash
___________                      .__ .____     .__           __   
\__    ___/____ _______   _____  |__||    |    |__|  _______/  |_ 
  |    | _/ __ \\_  __ \ /     \ |  ||    |    |  | /  ___/\   __\
  |    | \  ___/ |  | \/|  Y Y  \|  ||    |___ |  | \___ \  |  |  
  |____|  \___  >|__|   |__|_|  /|__||_______ \|__|/____  > |__|  
              \/              \/             \/         \/

You can run this script everytime you need to update the to do list since every added item will append onto the txt file that was generated during your first run.

It will also let you create a directory to store the txt file and check if you already have a directory by the same name, so you won't have to worry about creating a duplicate directory. This way you can store multiple lists in multiple directories.

# Usage
```bash
chmod +x todo.sh
```

```bash
./todo.sh
```
